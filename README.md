# uwu twanspiwer

# react to weact
Package that uses uwu keywords as an alternative syntax for React. 

Creating a transpiler to convert regular code to uwu language would require a lot of complex programming and natural language processing. 

# Usage:





to transpile a React code with uwu keywords using the key-value pairs in a uwu.json file. This code reads the `uwu.json` file and stores its contents in a Go map. 

It then reads the React code from a `react-code.js` file, replaces all the uwu keywords with the React keywords using `strings.ReplaceAll`, and then writes the transpiled code to a new file named `transpiled-code.js`.
